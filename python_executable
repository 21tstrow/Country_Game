Goal of the game: take over all neighbouring countries
#of neighbouring countries -> easy 2, med 3, hard 4

To begin game: User chooses capitalist or communist economy, then chooses democracy or dictatorship
Initial stats change based on choice

The game functions as follows:
The higher a value, the lower the chance of a disaster in response to that event.
A player can preform two options per "Year" turn

Disaster list:
Starvation -> Low food: population decreases, happiness decreases
Invasion -> Low military might and bad foreign relations: country is seized by outsiders, GAME OVER
Natural disaster -> Low resource diversity: population decreases, happiness decreases
Coup -> Low population happiness, Low military might: country is seized, GAME OVER
Devolution -> Low population: pop. is too low so country reverts to farming society. GAME OVER
Ousted -> Democratic -> Low happiness: Voted out of office, GAME OVER
Ousted -> Dictatorship -> Low foriegn relations and low population happiness: country "liberated", GAME OVER

Options:
Subsidise Farming -> decrease government wealth, increase food
Take land -> decrease military might, increase resource diversity proportional to previous military might
Import -> decrease food or government wealth, increase resource diversity or food
Export -> decrease food or resource diversity, increase government wealth
Take over country -> if military might is greater than neighbouring country, gain 25% to every category but lose % military might proportional to neighbouring country's military might vs. own and 25% foreign relations; else, lose 50% military might and resource diversity
Increase innovation -> decrease government wealth and food, increase resource diversity and population happiness
Accept immigrants -> decrease food and government wealth, increase pop. and foreign_relations
Gift -> decrease government wealth, increase foriegn relations
Deport citizens -> decrease pop. and population happiness, increase food resource and government wealth
Draft citizens -> decrease pop. and pop happiness, increase military might
Hold festival -> decrease government wealth, increase population happiness
Increase taxes -> decrease pop happiness, increase government wealth proportional to pop.
